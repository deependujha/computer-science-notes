# Multi-tasking Vs Multi-threading ü•∑üèª

## Concept üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Program:** A Program is an executable file which contains a certain set of instructions written
to complete the specific job or operation on your computer.
    - It‚Äôs a compiled code. Ready to be executed.
    - Stored in Disk

**Process:** `Program under execution`.
    -  Resides in Computer‚Äôs primary memory (RAM).

**Threads**: A thread is a lightweight process that runs within a larger process or within an operating system. It is also known as the thread of execution or the thread of control.

!!! info "Threads ü™°üß∂"

    - Single sequence stream within a process.
    - An independent path of execution in a process.
    - lightweight process. It is a smallest unit of processing.
    - A thread is a single sequence stream within in a process.
    - Because threads have some of the properties of processes, they are sometimes called `lightweight processes`.
    - Used to achieve parallelism by dividing a process's tasks which are independent path of execution.
    - Threads exist within a process ‚Äî every process has at least one. Threads share the process‚Äôs resources, including memory and open files.
    - E.g., Multiple tabs in a browser, text editor (When you are typing in an editor, spell-checking, formatting of text and saving the text are done concurrently by multiple threads.)

## Multi-tasking Vs Multi-threading

| Multi-Tasking      | Multi-Threading                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| The execution of more than one task simultaneously       | A process is divided into several different sub-tasks called as threads, which has its own path of execution. This concept is called as multithreading.  |
| Concept of more than 1 processes being context switched.       | Concept of more than 1 thread. Threads are context switched. |
| **Isolation and memory protection exists**. OS must allocate separate memory and resources to each program that CPU is executing.    | No isolation and memory protection, resources are shared among threads of that process. OS allocates memory to a process; multiple threads of that process share the same memory and resources allocated to the process. |

## Thread Scheduling

- Threads are scheduled for execution based on their priority.
- Even though threads are executing within the runtime, all threads are assigned processor time slices by the operating system.

## Thread Context Switching Vs Process Context Switching

| Thread Context Switching      | Process Context Switching                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| OS saves current state of thread & switches to another thread of same process.      | OS saves current state of process & switches to another process by restoring its state.  |
| Doesn‚Äôt includes switching of memory address space. (But Program counter, registers & stack are included.)       | Includes switching of memory address space. |
| Fast switching.   | Slow switching. |
|CPU‚Äôs cache state is preserved.   | CPU‚Äôs cache state is flushed. |

???+ warning "If threads are so good concept, why don't we make 100s or 1000s of threads?"

    - **You can create as many threads as you want, but you will only get as much parallelism as the number of cores in your CPU.**
    - Threads are not free. `Each thread consumes memory for its stack and other data structures`. 
    - Threads also require time to create and destroy. 
    - `If you have too many threads, the overhead of managing them can exceed the benefit of parallelism`.
